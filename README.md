# Decentralized Certificate Verification Using Blockchain
**Abstract**

The rapid increase in digital certification has led to a growing risk of forged and tampered credentials. This project presents a decentralized certificate verification system built on the Ethereum blockchain, designed to ensure authenticity, transparency, and immutability of certificates. By storing cryptographic hashes of certificates on the blockchain, the system enables instant and trustless verification without relying on centralized authorities.
